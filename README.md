# shipyard
An opinionated infrastructure for high velocity development that you own.  

This software wont magically conjure up a good culture of software development which require stuff like, actually being agile, understand the why of TDD, testing strategies and DORA. But This infrastructure will enable it!

The focus of this infrastructure is on getting started for medium and small size companies/organizations that quickly wants to get up and running with modern software development. This will run all the tools required for multiple deploys per day in a cloud native way using kubernetes. w 

This infrastructure will only be focused on running single clusters. This will always be a focus and a default. A team starting out with with running kubernetes workloads and enable their internal IT organization with it should not try and go for more then they need. When you start scaling to multiple regions over the world your prioritization becomes wildly different, requiring a decent sized in-house team to manage, so no real need for anything like this.
